This video shows the inference ability of the robot in the simulation using the haptic device Geomagic Touch: https://youtu.be/5x8iK3SmcG0

In this video, we teach the probabilistic lifting primitive to our simulated robotic arm. We start moving the arm using the Geomagic, holding its dark button.
When the user releases the button, the robot continues the movement on its own with the predicted trajectory.

This video shows the inference ability of the robot in the offline simulation, with plot representations of the results: https://youtu.be/NR78BB0f4Ss

Finally, the following video shows the experiment on the real iCub with real physical interaction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLiZSZBMEDA&feature=youtu.be
